# face-recognition
Face Recognition is a recognition technique used to detect faces of individuals whose images saved in the data set. Despite the point that other methods of identification can be more accurate, face recognition has always remained a significant focus of research because of its non-meddling nature and because it is people’s facile method of personal identification.
Categorical crossentropy was the loss function used.Categorical crossentropy will compare the distribution of the predictions (the activations in the output layer, one for each class) with the true distribution, where the probability of the true class is set to 1 and 0 for the other classes. To put it in a different way, the true class is represented as a one-hot encoded vector, and the closer the model’s outputs are to that vector, the lower the loss.
The accuracy is very high as transfer learning was used in it. We have used vgg16 model for the transfer learning. Adam is the weight optimiser to be used for the model building.
